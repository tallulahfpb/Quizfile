## Why did I pick this question?
> I picked the question above, ""Generally speaking, is it rude to say more than a few words to the stranger sitting next to you on a plane?" because this is a shift that falls along generational lines. Before phones and private headsets, talking was a far more popular way to pass the time on a flight. Now, it is not common. However, this does not mean that it is rude, but I would say the percantage that think it is rude is higher than it used to be. 

## What did I find interesting? 
> I found this dataset interesting because plane etiquette is an unspoken rule, but there is clearly a large amount of variation in what is considered "proper etiquette".

## What does my chart show?
> My chart shows that the vast majority of those who took the survey do not think it is rude to say more than a few words.
